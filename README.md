# Ticker Type Text

## About

This is a jQuery Plugin designed to mimick a typewriter or news ticker.

## Requirements

This has been tested to work with jQuery 2.1.3. or later. Not sure but should work with previous versions.

## Use

This is designed to take a html collection and transform this into ticker type text output in the browser.

e.g. 

### HTML

The collection of strings we want to animate can be extracted from a htmk collection.

e.g.

```
<div id="holder" class="text tt-holder">
  <p class="tt">Your partner for change </p>
  <p class="tt">Your partner for impact </p>
  <p class="tt">Your partner for Net Zero </p>
  <p class="tt">Your partner for B Corp </p>
  <h1 class="ttt"></h1>
</div>
```
In this example I have also used `ttt` as a classname. I will use this to target the output of my ticker type text. 

### CSS

I have included some base styles that can be modified. The main thing here is to hide the text we are using for a collection.

e.g.

```
.tt {
  display: none;
}
```
### JS

The ticker can be instantiated like so:

```
let animatetext = function(){
  let $elements = $(".tt-holder .tt");
  $(".ttt").writeText($elements, 17, 2, 30, 1, 0.7, 3);
}
$(animatetext) ;

```
## Parameters

### contents

contents an html collection or array object. 

### keep

integer determining the number of text chars to keep between iterations e.g. 17

### seconds

integer determining the numer of seconds the animation will take. e.g 5

### speed

integer of delay between inserting text items in milliseconds defaults to 20

### iterations

integer for determing number of iterations for the entire collection. 0 denotes infinite,

### ratio

float determing the relative value between when the animation starts and when it ends. This is usually weighted to prevent a large time delay at te end while also ensuring that there is not a gap between lines. e.g. 0.8

### secondsout

When using the keep feature, when set, this paramter allows configuration over the speed second part or subsequent frames. This can be higher or lower than that of the first frame.
