Hi Daniel, I‚Äôm following up with more specifics on the first issue we‚Äôd like you to take a look at. As mentioned in the original brief we are looking to build an ongoing relationship with further tasks in the future. The course search results page urls of the StudyLink.com <http://studylink.com/> website is being abused for spam purposes by third parties. For example the url below is linked to from a site other than our own. https://studylink.com/?s <https://studylink.com/?s>=ü™Ä‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏èwww.weke.xyz <http://www.weke.xyz/>ü™Ä‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏èstrasburg+va+singles+association.+strasburg+va+singles+association+talbkwiyvh Our search results pages do not follow this structure, for example our legitimate course search results pages look like this: https://studylink.com/search/results?keywords=business <https://studylink.com/search/results?keywords=business> https://studylink.com/search/results?keywords=film&country=AU&level-of-study=Undergraduate <https://studylink.com/search/results?keywords=film&country=AU&level-of-study=Undergraduate> The spammed search results pages are then picked up in Google search console as a 500 http error: https://studylink.com/search/%F0%9F%AA%80%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8Fwww.weke.xyz%F0%9F%AA%80%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8Fstrasburg+va+singles+association.+strasburg+va+singles+association+talbkwiyvh/ <https://studylink.com/search/%F0%9F%AA%80%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8Fwww.weke.xyz%F0%9F%AA%80%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8Fstrasburg+va+singles+association.+strasburg+va+singles+association+talbkwiyvh/> We need to prevent the course search from allowing this to happen, perhaps by rejecting search parameters that don‚Äôt fit an expected pattern Please can you let me know if you think this can be resolved, approximately how long this will take and, aside from access to a branched version of the codebase, what else you would require from us?
